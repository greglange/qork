To run the example:

1)  You'll need an Amazon SQS account and set of keys.

2)  Install the daemonx module.  You can run "sudo python setup.py develop" to
do that.

3)  Install the qork module.  You can run "sudo python setup.py develop" to
do that.

4)  Make a directory ~/qork_example and copy all the files from this directory
into it.  Change dir into ~/qork_example.

5)  Edit the example.conf file.  Add sqs keys.  Change user to your user.

6)  Run "./make_messages.py example.conf" to make the work messages.

7)  Run "qork-manager example.conf -L" to see the message queues and their
message counts.

8)  Run "qork-manager example.conf -P | less" to see the messages.

9)  Run the qork daemon to process the messages by running
"daemonx example.conf qork_daemon run_once".

10)  Run "ls *.result" and "cat *.result" to see the files created by the
workers.

11)  Run "qork-manager example.conf -L" and "qork-manager example.conf -P" to
see that the work messages are gone and that some of the division work was
moved to a failure queue.  Note that the exceptions that cause the failures
appear in the messages.  Also note that there are three exceptions for each
message because the work was attempted three times before being moved to
the failure queue.

12)  Run "qork-manager example.conf -r example_divide_failure" to move the
failed example_divide messages back to their work queue.  If the failure of a
worker is due to a temporary thing or a thing that has been fixed, the work
can be rescheduled in this way.  Run "qork-manager example.conf -L" to see
that the messages were moved back and run "qork-manager example.conf -P" to
see that the exceptions were cleared from the messages.
